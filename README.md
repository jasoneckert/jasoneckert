# Welcome to my public corner on GitHub! 
An ancient C worshippper, I mostly dabble in Rust today, as well as play with the odd JavaScript framework.
I take on at least one project per year that piques my interest, but you won't find those here ;-)

You can also check out this [cool GitHub wall art](https://triosdevelopers.com/jason.eckert/stuff/invertocat2.jpg) made from birch wood. It serves as a good reminder to regularly commit and push.
